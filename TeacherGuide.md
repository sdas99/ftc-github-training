## 📝 Lesson Notes

### Lesson 1 – Hello Git
- File: `Lesson1_HelloGit/HelloGit.java`
- Students add their name to output
- Commit + push
- Show their contributions on GitHub web

### Lesson 2 – Telemetry Edit
- File: `Lesson2_TelemetryEdit/BasicTeleOp.java`
- Students add name to telemetry
- Emphasize **clear commit messages**
- Pull to see each other’s changes

### Lesson 3 – Conflict Practice
- File: `Lesson3_ConflictPractice/TeamColors.java`
- Two students edit same line → conflict
- Guide them through conflict resolution in Android Studio

### Lesson 4 – Branch Demo
- File: `Lesson4_Branches/BranchDemo.java`
- Create and switch to branch
- Commit a change, push branch
- Merge branch into main

## ✅ Best Practices to Emphasize
- Always **pull before coding**
- Commit **small changes often**
- Use **clear commit messages**
- Test before pushing to avoid breaking code for teammates

## 🎉 Wrap-Up Idea
Download final merged code to the FTC robot controller (if available) and show students their names on telemetry. This connects GitHub skills directly to the robot.

# GitHub Cheat Sheet (FTC Edition)

- **Clone**: Get the project from GitHub → `File → New → Project from Version Control`.
- **Pull**: Get the latest code from teammates → `VCS → Update Project`.
- **Commit**: Save your work → `VCS → Commit`.
- **Push**: Share your work → `VCS → Commit and Push`.
- **Branch**: A side quest → `Git → New Branch`.

⚡ Golden Rules:
1. Always **pull before coding**.
2. Commit often with clear messages.
3. Push when done, so teammates see your work.
